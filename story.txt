A Volt traveled through Orb Vallis. He saw a Nezha being knocked down. He saved Nezha with his sniper rifle. He found out Nezha was an edgelord.

He decided to go home. At home he wanted to relax, so he sat down and watched
TV.

He slept while watching tv. It was so good a sleep that he missed all morning classes next day. But it was worth it.

Sleep is really underrated these days.  A good sleep is essential to a productive day.  Nezha and all of us should try to sleep more.

Volt had a dream about Nezha. He was jealous of Nezha's hardwork. He decided to treat things more seriously. He had a good GPA in the end.
